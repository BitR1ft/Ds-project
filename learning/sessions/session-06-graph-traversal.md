# Session 6: Graph Traversal - BFS and DFS

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Goal:** Master graph traversal for ransomware behavior detection

## Overview
Learn breadth-first and depth-first search to analyze file access patterns and detect malicious behavior.

## BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Level-by-level traversal
- Uses queue
- Finds shortest paths
- Good for: Layer-by-layer analysis

## DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Go deep first
- Uses stack/recursion
- Explores all paths
- Good for: Detecting cycles, full exploration

## Ransomware Detection
Use BFS/DFS to:
- Track file access order
- Detect rapid encryption patterns
- Identify suspicious traversal
- Compare normal vs. malicious behavior

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E) for both
**Space Complexity:** O(V) for visited tracking

See you in Session 7!
