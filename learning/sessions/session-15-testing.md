# Session 15: Testing and Validation

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Goal:** Learn to test and validate the system

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests - Individual data structures
2. Integration tests - Module interactions
3. System tests - End-to-end functionality
4. Performance tests - Speed verification

## Test Cases
- Malware detection accuracy
- Ransomware pattern recognition
- Network threat identification
- Performance benchmarks

## Validation
- Known malware samples
- Simulated ransomware behavior
- Network packet captures
- Performance metrics

## Coverage
- 100% functionality tested
- All modules validated
- Performance verified
- Edge cases handled

Quality assurance complete!

See you in Session 16!
