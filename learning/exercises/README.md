# Practice Exercises

This directory contains exercises for each learning session to reinforce concepts.

## Exercise Structure

Each session has corresponding exercises:
- **Beginner:** Basic concept application
- **Intermediate:** Problem solving with the data structure
- **Advanced:** Optimization and complex scenarios
- **Challenge:** Real-world application problems

## How to Use

1. **Read the exercise description**
2. **Try to solve it yourself** (don't peek at solution!)
3. **Test your solution**
4. **Compare with provided solution**
5. **Understand any differences**
